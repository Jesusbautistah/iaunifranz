## Model information

This directory contains a tiny llama model that is used to test the API client in our example tests.

The model source is from [here](https://huggingface.co/aladar/llama-2-tiny-random-GGUF/) thanks to [aladar on huggingface](https://huggingface.co/aladar) and was likely inspired originally by this [tweet from @StasBekman](https://twitter.com/StasBekman/status/1724519457790509310) and it's [accompanying huggingface mode](https://huggingface.co/stas/tiny-random-llama-2).

It's a simple model that mostly produces gibberish, but for unit testing purposes it works great.
